## 📦 Modular by Design

Voxx is built around different speaker sizes that all work together:

- **Voxx Dot**  
  Ultra-compact core speaker. Small, portable, but surprisingly powerful.

- **Voxx Core**  
  The all-rounder. Balanced sound, strong bass, perfect for everyday use.

- **Voxx Stack**  
  Large, high-output speaker for parties, outdoor use, or small PA setups.

All Voxx speakers are designed to **connect, sync, and scale**.

## 🔗 Connect Everything

Voxx is designed to support:
- Multi-speaker setups
- Wireless or wired linking (depending on build)
